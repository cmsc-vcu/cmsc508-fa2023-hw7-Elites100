1. The `/hw7` folder contains the main files for the homework assignment.
2. `hw7.qmd` is the source code file that includes answered qmd file with query statements for each of the questions and addtional descriptions
3. `hw7.html` contains the rendered version of the `hw7.qmd` file, which can be viewed in your web browser.
4. `hw7.ipynb`is a python notebook that is used to run the codes from a cell for preview and identical to the qmd file
